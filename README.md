This repository accompanies the ShinyApp hosted here : https://sjbothwell.shinyapps.io/sct_developmental_milestones/

Code to build the ShinyApp can be found within the developmental_milestones folder, titled "app.R". When saving to your files, the data files and www folder will need to be in the same folder as the app. The www folder contains images that are used within the app, the eXtraordinarY babies study logo and the primary developmental milestones plot.

A sex chromosome trisomy (SCT) is characterized by an extra sex chromosome. This could be an extra X or Y chromosome in men (typically XY) or an extra X chromosome in women (typically XX). The most common of these is Klinefelter syndrome, XXY, which occurs in 1 of 600 males. Children with SCT are known to achieve developmental milestones later than the general population. Developmental milestones include motor (such as crawling, walking, running, jumping, etc.) and language (babbling, cooing, 2-word phrases, etc). The goal of this project is to enhance a ShinyApp visualization tool for clinical collaborators, who study the growth and development of children with an SCT. This app is a tool for use within the clinic to monitor a participant's development.
